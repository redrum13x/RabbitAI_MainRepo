## Morning Session

### Competitive Analysis Added to AI Opportunities Doc
- Grant requested cross-referencing our AI opportunities against industry/competitors
- Added to `ai-opportunities-exec-summary.md`:
  - Competitive Landscape Overview (Intelex, Enablon, VelocityEHS, SafetyCulture, etc.)
  - Computer Vision specialists (Intenseye, Protex AI, Voxel)
  - Wearables players (Kinetic, Soter Analytics)
  - 12-month competitor predictions
  - Industry trends (LLM commoditization, edge AI, regulatory scrutiny)
  - Competitive context per opportunity
  - Competitive urgency ratings
  - Strategic positioning section (where to lead vs fast-follow)
- Added Hazard Detection as #10 (was missing from opportunities list)
- Rabbit_Coder regenerated PDF (573KB, 16+ pages)
