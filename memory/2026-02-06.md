## Morning Session

### Competitive Analysis Added to AI Opportunities Doc
- Grant requested cross-referencing our AI opportunities against industry/competitors
- Added to `ai-opportunities-exec-summary.md`:
  - Competitive Landscape Overview (Intelex, Enablon, VelocityEHS, SafetyCulture, etc.)
  - Computer Vision specialists (Intenseye, Protex AI, Voxel)
  - Wearables players (Kinetic, Soter Analytics)
  - 12-month competitor predictions
  - Industry trends (LLM commoditization, edge AI, regulatory scrutiny)
  - Competitive context per opportunity
  - Competitive urgency ratings
  - Strategic positioning section (where to lead vs fast-follow)
- Added Hazard Detection as #10 (was missing from opportunities list)
- Rabbit_Coder regenerated PDF (573KB, 16+ pages)

### Agent Orchestration Visibility
- Grant noted I wasn't posting to #agent-activity channel
- Fixed: now posting task dispatches and completions there
- Need to formalize orchestration rules

### Process Improvements Discussion
Planning to implement:
1. Web search (Brave API) — awaiting key from Grant
2. Agent orchestration rules — documenting today
3. Board usage — adding tasks now
4. Daily logs — this file
5. MEMORY.md curation — doing today
6. Google Drive — awaiting password
7. Calendar access — awaiting details

## Tasks
- [x] Add competitive analysis to AI opportunities doc
- [x] Regenerate PDF with competitive content
- [x] Start posting to #agent-activity for visibility
- [x] Get Brave API key configured ✅
- [x] Set up Google Drive access ✅
- [x] Add current work to kanban board ✅
- [x] Document agent orchestration rules ✅
- [x] Review/curate MEMORY.md ✅

## Afternoon Session

### Configuration Updates
- Brave API key configured at `tools.web.search.apiKey` (not the previously attempted `webSearch.brave.apiKey`)
- Google Drive access granted for redrum137@gmail.com

### Pending
- Final hazard detection PDF — video/CCTV included, AR/wearables excluded

### Decisions
- Calendar integration on hold for now
- If calendar access needed, use redrum137@gmail.com (Google Calendar)

### Technical Notes
- Brave API config schema: `tools.web.search.enabled`, `tools.web.search.provider`, `tools.web.search.apiKey`
- PowerShell uses `;` not `&&` for command chaining

## Evening Session — Multi-Agent Discord Setup

### Gateway Watchdog Created
- Auto-restart on crash, runs hidden
- Pattern: VBS launches hidden CMD with infinite restart loop (~10s recovery)

### 6 New Agents Created
- **Rabbit_Creative** 🎨 — Creative content, storytelling, copywriting
- **Rabbit_Ops** 👁️ — Monitoring, infrastructure, system health
- **Rabbit_EHS** 🏭 — EHS domain expertise (OSHA, regulations)
- **Rabbit_Novara** 🏢 — Novara product context specialist
- **Rabbit_PO** 📋 — Product ownership, backlog, user stories
- **Rabbit_Security** 🔒 — Security review, threat modeling

### Discord Channels Created (Guild: 1468983642633146410)
| Channel | ID |
|---------|-----|
| #rabbit-creative | 1469358220241010768 |
| #rabbit-ops | 1469358221306232892 |
| #rabbit-ehs | 1469358221910081596 |
| #rabbit-novara | 1469358222740689059 |
| #rabbit-po | 1469358223818752170 |
| #rabbit-security | 1469358224380526839 |

### Rabbit_Creative Bot Fixed
- Token restored: `[REDACTED]`
- Bot ID: `1469359073647657252`
- Bot is ONLINE ✅

### Config Corruption Issue Diagnosed
- `accounts` and `bindings` sections were getting wiped during restarts
- Root cause: Using `config.apply` instead of `config.patch` with baseHash
- Fix: Always use `config.patch` with baseHash to preserve sections

### Identity Bug Identified
- **Problem**: Messages in #rabbit-creative showing as Rabbit_AI instead of Rabbit_Creative
- **Root cause**: 
  1. Bindings array empty in config — both bots listening to #rabbit-creative
  2. Subagents inherit main agent's delivery context
  3. Outbound messages depend on session's delivery context, not bindings
- **Fix needed**: Configure bindings to exclude #rabbit-creative from Rabbit_AI bot scope

### Bot IDs
- Rabbit_AI (main): `1468629994006646784`
- Rabbit_Creative: `1469359073647657252`

### Key Technical Learnings
- **Single gateway, multiple Discord bots**: Use `channels.discord.accounts` for multi-bot
- **Bindings control INBOUND only**: Where messages route TO
- **Outbound follows session context**: Spawned subagents inherit main agent's delivery
- **config.patch > config.apply**: Preserves existing config sections

## Notes
- CV = Computer Vision (Grant asked for clarification)
- All Novara items marked as private on the board
- **9 total agents**: Rabbit 🐇, Coder 💻, Researcher 🔍, Creative 🎨, Ops 👁️, EHS 🏭, Novara 🏢, PO 📋, Security 🔒
