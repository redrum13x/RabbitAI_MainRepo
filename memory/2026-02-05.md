## Major Accomplishments

### Multi-Agent System Deployed
- Created **Rabbit_Coder** 💻 — coding sub-agent (spawnable)
- Created **Rabbit_Researcher** 🔍 — research sub-agent (spawnable)
- Configured spawn permissions via OpenClaw config patching
- Each agent has their own workspace with SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md

### Rabbit Board Enhanced
- Deployed to GitHub Pages: https://redrum13x.github.io/RabbitAI_MainRepo/kanban/
- Added agent avatars with active status indicators (cyan glow)
- Agent legend footer showing team status
- tasks.json as source of truth

### AI Opportunities Package
Created analysis of 9 AI opportunities for Novara (EHS/Compliance):
1. Policy Interpretation Engine
2. Document Ingestion & Normalization
3. Incident Summarization
4. Root Cause Clustering
5. Corrective Action Drafting
6. Audit Prep Automation
7. Customer Policy Mapping
8. Questionnaire/RFP Automation
9. Smart Onboarding Assistant

(Removed AR/wearables from consideration per Grant's direction)

### Hazard Detection Deep Dive
Grant shared internal documents:
- AI Hazard Identification Feedback (model evaluation notes)
- KPA Model Quantitative Accuracy (accuracy metrics)
- Construction Hazard Detection architecture diagram

**Key findings from their evaluation:**
- Tested 3 models: Claude Haiku, Amazon Nova Lite, Pixtral Large
- Amazon Nova: 45% severity match, cheapest ($0.0005/inference)
- Claude: 27% match but best detail/reasoning ($0.0016/inference)
- All models over-classify (need "no hazard" option)

**Architecture decisions made:**
- Two-stage inference: Nova for triage → Claude for deep analysis
- PostgreSQL (not DynamoDB) — already in their stack
- Offline-first: queue locally, sync when connected
- Video/CCTV included in scope; AR/wearables deferred

**Deliverables created:**
- Multiple PDF versions (iterated on formatting)
- DOCX (editable in Google Docs)
- PPTX (11 slides for Google Slides)
- All moved to private repo

### Repository Security
- Created private repo: https://github.com/redrum13x/Rabbit_ClosedRepo
- Moved all Novara-sensitive docs to private repo
- Scrubbed git history from public repo (filter-branch)
- Public repo now clean of confidential content

## Key Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL over DynamoDB** — They already have Aurora, no need for another DB
2. **Two-stage model approach** — Nova for 80% (cheap/accurate), Claude for 20% (detailed)
3. **Offline-first mobile** — Critical for field workers with poor connectivity
4. **Video/CCTV in scope** — But AR/wearables deferred to future
5. **No specific timelines** — List what needs to be built without dates

## Technical Notes

- Web search disabled (no Brave API key)
- PDF generation: Use Edge headless with `--no-pdf-header-footer`
- Private workspace: `C:\Users\Grant\.openclaw\workspace-private`
- Rabbit_Coder workspace: `C:\Users\Grant\.openclaw\workspace-rabbit_coder`

## Current State

Grant wants exec-ready one-pagers for all 9 AI opportunities — surface level but enough for execs to make go/no-go decisions. Starting this next.

## Grant's Company Context

- **Company:** Novara (formerly KPA)
- **Product:** FLEX App for safety observations
- **Current tech:** AWS (S3, Aurora PostgreSQL, EC2), mobile app
- **Evaluating:** AI-powered hazard detection from photos
