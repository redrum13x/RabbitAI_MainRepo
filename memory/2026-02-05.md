## Major Accomplishments

### Multi-Agent System Deployed
- Created **Rabbit_Coder** 💻 — coding sub-agent
- Created **Rabbit_Researcher** 🔍 — research sub-agent
- Configured spawn permissions in OpenClaw
- Set up workspaces with SOUL.md, AGENTS.md for each

### Rabbit Board Enhanced
- Deployed to GitHub Pages: https://redrum13x.github.io/RabbitAI_MainRepo/kanban/
- Added agent avatars with active status indicators (cyan glow)
- Agent legend footer showing team status
- tasks.json as source of truth (Rabbit manages, web view reads)

### AI Opportunities Package Delivered

  - Phased roadmap (Q1-Q4)
  - Dependency diagram
  - Success metrics
  
- **Tech Architecture Diagrams** (`novara-ai/tech-diagrams.html`) — Rabbit_Coder built this
  - 15 Mermaid.js flowcharts
  - Shows components, data flow, AI layers, integrations
  
- **Competitive Research** (`novara-ai/competitive-research.md`)
  - Major EHS software players
  - CV/PPE detection vendors
  - Wearables companies
  - Drone inspection players
  - Market size and drivers
