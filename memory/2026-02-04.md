## Setup Day

- Discord bot configured ("Rabbit" — was "AnthBot")
- Auto-start on Windows login via Startup folder VBS script
- Running in background, no terminal window

## Role Defined

Grant wants me as **Sr. AI Technical Product Manager** — second brain, co-worker.

## Guardrails Established

- Only communicate with Grant (no third parties without approval)
- Safety/security paramount
- Irreversible actions → confirm first
- No plain text credential storage
- If unsure → sit tight, never act alone
- Permission is paramount

## Still To Do

- ~~Learn about Grant's current role/company~~ ✓
- Understand what he's working on
- Figure out where I plug in to help

## In Progress

- **Rabbit Board** (kanban app) - built, needs deployment (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
  - Location: `workspace/kanban/index.html`
  - Uses jsonblob.com for cloud sync
  - Ready to use locally now
